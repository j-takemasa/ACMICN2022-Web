**August 26th, 2022 is the camera-ready deadline** for all accepted papers (full, short, SoK, vision, poster, and demo).

Before submitting camera-ready papers, authors of accepted papers will need to complete the ACM rights management form. You will be notified once these forms are available and ready to sign. You must agree to videotaping in the forms for the conference to use your pre-recorded talk.

After completing their rights management form, authors will be emailed the correct rights management text and bibliographic strip to place within their paper. **It is essential that authors enter the text into their paper.**

As rights management emails are sent from an automated system, there is a chance that emails sent will wind up in SPAM folders. Please make sure that you and your authors set email SPAM settings to allow emails from “rightsreview@acm.org”.

ACM ICN 2022 also uses HotCRP for collecting camera ready submissions. Please go to the ACM ICN 2022 Submission Site at [https://icn22.hotcrp.com/](https://icn22.hotcrp.com/) or Posters and Demos Submission Site at [https://icn22demoposter.hotcrp.com](https://icn22demoposter.hotcrp.com). Please prepare your paper according to the instructions provided below :

- Full papers should be no more than ten (10) pages, EXCLUDING references, appendices, and acknowledgements.
- Short papers should be no more than six (6) pages, EXCLUDING references, appendices and acknowledgements. 
- For Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, the limit is ten (10) pages, EXCLUDING references, appendices and acknowledgements.
- For vision and position papers, the limit is two (2) pages, EXCLUDING references, appendices and acknowledgements.
- For posters and demos, the limit is two (2) pages, EXCLUDING references and acknowledgements.
- Font size for the main text is the same as in the provided template (9 pt). This is in contrast to the 10pt font in the initial submission to allow authors extra space to address reviewers’ comments.
- Include names and affiliations of all authors in the title page.
- Please do NOT number the pages of your camera-ready paper.
- ACM templates can be found under: [http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Please follow the instructions on this page.
- As described on the above template webpage, the authors should provide proper indexing information in the final version according to the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS). More information about the ACM CCS is available on [ACM CCS website](https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012).
- Please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words.
- Submit the source files and PDF (Portable Document Format) of your camera-ready paper. Avoid using any special characters or non-standard fonts. We must be able to display and print your submission exactly as we receive it using only standard tools and printers, so we strongly suggest that you use only standard fonts embedded in the PDF file.
- Ensure that labels and symbols used in graphs and figures are legible, including the font sizes of tick marks, axis labels, legends, etc.
- Limit the file size to less than 15MB. 
- NOTE: please contact the conference publications chair Onur Ascigil [o.ascigil@lancaster.ac.uk](o.ascigil@lancaster.ac.uk) if you have questions about use of the ACM document templates or generating your camera-ready final paper copy.

All camera-ready papers should have the rights management statement and bibliographic strip on the bottom of the first page left column. Text to be provided after the rights management form is completed by the authors as noted above.

Papers should have Type 1 fonts (scalable), not Type 3 (bit-mapped). **All fonts MUST be embedded within the PDF file.** Any PDF that is not deposited with fonts embedded will need to be corrected. In order to help you through this process, [ACM has created documentation on how to embed your fonts](http://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word-to-pdf-instructions-.txt). Please download the ACM Digital Library optimal distiller settings file, [ACM.joboptions](http://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/acm1.joboptions). ACM cannot substitute font types, though. This really must be done in the source files before the Postscript or PDF is generated. If bit-mapped fonts are used, they will not necessarily display legibly in all PDF readers on all platforms, though they will print out fine.

**Supplements and/or Auxiliary Material**

ACM calls extra files to be  reviewed with the submitted paper “Supplements.” An example might be a  proof that is too long to be included within the allotted number of  pages but which is supplied as an online-only Appendix. Another example might be a program which is the actual subject matter  of the paper. Supplements are an integral part of the paper and are  published with it as such. rights management of the paper applies as  well to these integral Supplements. Checking Part I of the form transfers rights management on the paper and its  Supplements.

ACM calls extra files which  are not reviewed as part of the submitted paper but which an author  supplies as an additional resource for the reader “Auxiliary Materials.” An example might be an extensive data set used in the research for the paper, or programs that were run on that data  to derive the results. ACM will not take copyright to Auxiliary Material which is not reviewed and is not part of the formally published work.  But ACM still needs permission from the owner to serve Auxiliary Materials and an agreement that the author is  abiding by ACM terms when supplying the non-reviewed Auxiliary Material. Checking Part II of the form and saying YES to the terms grants ACM  permission to serve the Auxiliary Materials.

In the event that an author is supplying both kinds of files, Supplements and Auxiliary Materials,  they should be provided in separate zips and labeled as such - aux.zip  or suppl.zip. A short readme file the author provides will appear in the Digital Library along with each Supplement  and/or Auxiliary Material describing the content and whatever  requirements there are for using it.
