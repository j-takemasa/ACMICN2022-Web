The conference presentations will be delivered live online, but we would also like to collect pre-recorded videos and presentation slides in case there are any technical problems during the live presentations.

### Video Submission Deadline

End of day on **September 9, 2022**

### Update Location

- For full/short/SoK paper: [https://www.dropbox.com/request/9IXJjhpDaU1GJEWWeCZk](https://www.dropbox.com/request/9IXJjhpDaU1GJEWWeCZk)
- For poster/demo paper: [https://www.dropbox.com/request/ibe1FIsQnboOkLgzJyzQ](https://www.dropbox.com/request/ibe1FIsQnboOkLgzJyzQ)

### Video Length and Format
- The duration of full/short/SoK paper presentation video is 20 minutes. In the case of poster/demo paper presentation video, the duration is 3 minutes.

- **Tool**: ACM ICN 2022 will not recommend a specific video capture tool. Presenters can use various video conferencing tools or dedicated video recording software.

- **Video Format and Resolution**: The video format must be mp4. The preferred resolution is 1080p/HD if possible but 720P is also acceptable. We do not require a specific bitrate, but we expect videos be of good quality (3000-10,000kb/s rate is good). Depending on the software you are using to record/edit the video, file size can vary, 250 MB - 1.0 GB per 20-minute presentation is good. 

- **Presenter’s headshot**: the presentation should show slide contents in the main area, with the presenter video in a smaller window (either picture-in-picture or other equivalent composition). Use head/shoulder composition for the presentation rather than larger view areas. Transitions from slides to speaker and back are acceptable when appropriate.

- **Clothing**: plain clothing in solid color (no prints, logos, graphics etc.) tend to give better quality results.

- **Videos in slide shows**: do not include videos or fast-moving animations in the slide show material. If video is required please send it separately and will be shown after the slide presentation.

- **Language/images**: please use care not to have any stereotypical or potentially offensive wording, images, or animations. These will be flagged during review and videos will have to be redone.

- **Subtitles**: as the videos will be uploaded to the ACM YouTube Channel there is no need to worry about subtitles.

- **Video file name**: before uploading your video file, please name it using the following naming convention:
**{your-paper-id-number}-{presenter-name}-{affiliation}.mp4**
where {your-paper-id-number} is the unique number handled in the submission site of HotCRP.
- **Slides** : The presentation slides file should be in PDF format using a similar naming convention:
**{your-paper-id-number}-{presenter-name}-{affiliation}.pdf**
