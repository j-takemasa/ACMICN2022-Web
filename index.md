## Welcome to 9th Annual ACM ICN 2022 Conference!

The 9th ACM Conference on Information Centric Networking (ICN 2022) will be held in hybrid* mode from September 19-21, 2022 in Osaka, Japan.

The fundamental concept in Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is to provide accessing named data as a principal network service, evolving the Internet from today’s host based packet delivery towards directly retrieving information objects by names in a secure, reliable, scalable, and efficient way. These architectural design efforts aim to directly address the challenges that arise from the increasing demands for highly scalable content distribution, from accelerated growths of mobile devices, from wide deployment of Internet-of-things (IoT), and from the need to secure the global Internet. ACM ICN 2022 will be a single track conference focusing on current ICN research topics, featuring paper presentations and demonstrations.

*NOTE: The organizers are planning for an on-site conference, and encourage authors and the community to attend if possible.  However, due to uncertainties about future prevalence of COVID-19, national travel restrictions, and individual health considerations, an option for attending and presenting remotely is also planned for those unable to travel. Uncertainty about modality should not prevent anyone from submitting to ICN.

## Important Notice for On-site Attendance
**A person who is not a resident in Japan currently needs a visa to enter Japan. To apply for a visa, you must first get "Certificate for Completion of Registration to the ERFS System" and go to the Japanese embassy or consulate in your country with the ERFS certificate to apply a visa. If you plan to attend ACM ICN 2022 on-site, please carefully check [the visa information page](visa.html).**
