The 9th ACM Conference on Information Centric Networking (ICN 2022) will be held in hybrid mode from September 19-21, 2022 in Japan. The organizing committee invites you to submit your research for presentation at ACM ICN 2022.

Information-centric networking opens a new direction to construct networks by digital objects named by applications. This year, we particularly encourage submissions exploring naming in networks, security, lessons learned from design and implementations, economic incentives and new applications that may help steer the Internet away from further consolidation and move toward decentralization. We aim to form an interdisciplinary exploration on the future of networking. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- System naming: What are the lessons learned from the name and identifier space designs of the Internet over the last 40 years that can be applied to ICN naming solution development?
- Security solutions from first principles: ICN enables securing data objects directly, which in turn requires security frameworks, trust establishment, and toolsets to enable automated key management.
- Identifying the challenges facing the Internet today: What are the root causes and how can we quantify whether and to what extent ICN-based solutions can address these challenges?
- Design and implementation of information-centric solutions, including domain-specific designs of namespaces, case studies of ICN-based applications and computation in various domains such as the Internet of Things, edge computing, and social media, together with empirical evaluations.

In addition to full (10 pages) and short (6 pages) technical papers, ACM ICN 2022 also encourages Systematization of Knowledge papers (10 pages), and short vision or position statements (2 pages; position papers may also inspire panel sessions). All submissions will be peer reviewed. Accepted submissions will be published by ACM in the Digital Library.

Papers can be submitted via [https://icn22.hotcrp.com/](https://icn22.hotcrp.com/) until May 28, 2022. More and up-to-date details are available on [https://conferences.sigcomm.org/acm-icn/2022](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/acm-icn/2022).

In case of questions, please contact the TPC Chairs via [icn22-tpc-chairs@sigcomm.org](mailto:icn22-tpc-chairs@sigcomm.org).

## Submission Types

ACM ICN 2022 solicits the following types of papers, page limits exclude references and appendices.:

- Full technical papers (max. 10 pages) that present mature research, typically bolstered by extensive experiments, simulations, or analytical results,
- Short technical papers (max. 6 pages) that present preliminary research, including less mature results but promising directions.
- Systematization of knowledge (SoK)  papers (max. 10 pages) that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. Those papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established ICN research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in an area with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title.
- Vision or position statements (max. 2 pages) that present crisp statements to identify and scope future research directions. This may include  lessons learned from past efforts, debating on different approaches in ICN solution developments, or identifying persistent problems in today’s Internet and their relations with the architecture. Those statements will provide valuable inputs to organizing panel sessions.Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “Statement:” in the title.

All submissions must follow the ACM SIGCOMM format (10pt font, sigconf option for acmart style). In case of acceptance, the camera-ready format will provide more space to address reviewer comments.

Submissions will be reviewed through a double-blind process, and evaluated on the basis of intellectual merit, originality, importance of contribution to the field, soundness and strength of evaluation (for full papers), quality and clarity of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work.

## Submission Instructions
Papers must be formatted for printing on Letter-sized (8.5" by 11") 
paper. Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with 
each column 9.25" by 3.33", 0.33" space between columns. Each column 
must use 10-point font or larger, and contain no more than 55 lines of 
text.

Please, use the current [ACM 
template](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip), 
and the following configuration:

* \documentclass[10pt,sigconf,anonymous]{acmart}
* \settopmatter{printacmref=false, printccs=false, printfolios=true}
* \setcopyright{none}
* \subtitle{Paper \# <HotCRP ID>, XXX pages}

SoK papers should include "SoK:" in the title, vision or position 
statements should include "Statement:".

Register and submit your paper by the deadline in the conference submission site: [https://icn22.hotcrp.com/](https://icn22.hotcrp.com/). ACM ICN follows a double-blind reviewing process, details see below.

If you have any questions about submitting papers to ICN 2022, or encounter problems with the paper submission site, contact the TPC chairs before the deadline via [icn22-tpc-chairs@sigcomm.org](mailto:icn22-tpc-chairs@sigcomm.org).


## Submission Compliance
Papers submitted for consideration must not have been already published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the consideration period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the [ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy) and the [ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/sim_submissions).

Like other conferences and journals, ICN prohibits violation of the above ACM Policies and may take action against authors who violate them. In some cases, the program committee may share information about submitted papers with other conference chairs and journal editors to ensure the compliance of papers under consideration. If the TPC discovers a violation of these principles, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, contacting the institutions of the authors and publicizing the details of the case.

 ICN will review extended versions of previously-published short preliminary papers (such as workshop papers) in accordance with published [ACM SIGCOMM](http://www.sigcomm.org/about/policies/frequently-asked-questions-faq/) policies. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement requests will not be considered.

## Paper Anonymity

All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through **double-blind** reviewing, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to make a good-faith effort to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity. Minimally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:

1. Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page.

2. Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources.

3. Use care in naming your files. Source file names (e.g., “Alice-n-Bob.dvi”) are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments.

4. Check the “Properties” (metadata) embedded in the file, and remove any identifying information before submitting.

5. Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author.

6. Work that extends an author’s previous workshop paper is welcome, but the paper should (a) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation and (b) carefully explain the differences between the ACM ICN’22 submission and the prior workshop paper.


## Conflicts of Interest

Both authors and TPC members must identify conflicts of interest according to the following general principles.

A program committee member (including the chairs of the committee) is considered to have a conflict of interest on a submission that has an author in any of the following categories: the person himself or herself; a past or current student or academic advisor; a supervisor or employee in the same line of authority within the past four years; a member of the same organization (e.g., company, university, government agency, etc.) within the past four years or in the near future (six months); a co-author of a paper appearing in publication within the past four years; someone with whom there has been a financial relationship (e.g., grants, contracts, consultancies, equity investments, stock options, etc.) within the past four years; someone with whom acceptance or rejection would further the personal goals of the reviewer (e.g., a competitor); a member of the same family or anyone considered a close personal friend; or someone about whom, for whatever reason, their work cannot be evaluated objectively. If there is no basis for the TPC conflicts provided by authors, however, those conflicts will be removed. Do not improperly indicate conflicts simply to prevent some TPC members from reviewing your paper.
