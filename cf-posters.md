## {{ page.title }}

The ICN poster and demo sessions are intended to showcase works-in-progress.
Topics of interest are the same as those listed in the [main track call for papers](cf-papers.html).
We strongly encourage both student and industry submissions.
Submissions should be accompanied by a two-page extended abstract, which will be published in the conference proceedings.

This year’s ICN will be held in hybrid mode from September 19-21, 2022 in Japan.
Presenters will need to record a short video explaining their poster or demo and participate in discussions during a dedicated session.

The posters and demos submitted to ACM ICN 2022 must be original and cannot be concurrently submitted to other workshops or conferences during the ACM ICN 2022 posters and demos review period.
All dual submissions will be rejected without review.

### Why should you submit a poster or a demo?

Presenting a poster is a great opportunity, especially for students, to obtain interesting and valuable feedback on ongoing research from a knowledgeable crowd at the conference.
Accepted posters and demos will be published as a two-page abstract for the archived conference proceedings. 

### What to submit

You must submit a two-page abstract in PDF format that describes your work.
The abstract should clearly state:
- (a) the problem being addressed,
- (b) what makes this problem interesting,
- (c) your approach, and
- (d) the key contribution.

Feel free to add a link to a preliminary version of your video.

### Preparation of Abstracts

Submissions will be reviewed through a **single-blind** process and must adhere conflict of interest policies [the same as for the main conference papers](cfp.html) (note that unlikes the main track submissions, the poster/demo submissions do not need to be anonymized).
Abstracts may be up to **two pages** in length, excluding references, following the [ACM SIGCOMM format](https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template/) (10pt font, `sigconf` option for `acmart` style).
The abstracts of accepted posters and demos will be available to all attendees at the conference.

### Where to Submit

Abstracts for posters and demos should be submitted via the [ICN 2022 Posters and Demos submission website](https://icn22demoposter.hotcrp.com/).
