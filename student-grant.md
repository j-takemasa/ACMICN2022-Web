The ACM ICN 2022, to be held on 19-21 Sept., 2022 is pleased to announce Student Conference Grant to support on-site participation at the conference. This student conference grant is sponsored by NICT, KDDI Research and Osaka University, and covers a student registration fee, includes main conference, tutorials, lunch and coffee.

NOTE: This grant does NOT cover travel expenses. And if you are not a Japanese resident, you must also state your visa status according to the visa information page.

### Eligibility Criteria
Applications are invited from qualified any full-time students registered toward a Bachelors, Masters, or Ph.D. degree in a college or university when submitting the application.

### Selection Criteria
The following criteria will be used in the selection process:
- Preference will be given to applicants that do not present a paper in the conference. The rationale for this criterion is that the participation costs for a presenting author should be covered by their home institution.
- Evidence of a serious interest in networking, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience, will be required. Advanced students close to graduation or in the job market will also be given priority, when possible.
- We also encourage participation of women and under-represented minorities. Special attention will be given to applicants from minority-serving institutions.
- After giving priority to the above criteria, (co-)authors of papers may be considered but will be given lower priority.

### Application Procedure
An application for a student conference grant will consist of the following documents, and incomplete applications will not be considered.
1. A request letter from the student (see below).
2. The student's resume.
3. A recommendation letter from the student's advisor.

The letter from the student should be at most one page, and include the following information:
